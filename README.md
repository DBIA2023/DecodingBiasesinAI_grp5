“The use of data-driven AI models in recruitment processes raises a host of thorny ethical issues, which demand forethought and diligent assessment on the part of both system designers and procurers.”

## Introduction
The advent of algorithmic hiring and the rise of HR tech platforms has completely changed traditional recruitment practices, promising efficiency, mitigating biases prevalent in hiring and streamline decision making protocols. However, as companies rely on automated systems for HR functions, concerns regarding biases inherent in autonomous systems have come to the forefront. Our research paper delves into the intricate landscape of exploring the biases within HR tech companies and their potential impact. First, we navigate through the general development trends in HR tech platforms, we examine the evolution of the tools being developed and adopted by organizations. Secondly, we analyze the market characteristics shaping the adoption and implementation of HR tech solutions, by scrutinizing market dynamics, we may discern how biases may be perpetuated or mitigated within different HR tech platforms. Furthermore, we delve into the origin of discrimination embedded within these platforms, as historical biases affect these autonomous systems, even though they were claimed to be neutral, exacerbating disparities in hiring. By exploring these central issues through our research, where we analyze Talenteria, a HR Tech Recruiting platform startup. Our research aimed to find out whether there are potential AI biases in their CV screening algorithms focusing on age, gender, ethnicity and origin. Finally, we are going to discuss our results and the limitations of our study accordingly.

## General Developments and Trends 
HR-tech platforms can assume a variety of functions, spanning from recruiting and onboarding to learning/skills management and termination processes (Exh. 1). Established HR Tech functions also include Payroll Management (Statista 2022) which is not examined in this paper as it is not prone to bias. Organizations have the option to procure these diverse functionalities from one or multiple developers or to develop them entirely in-house. However, the latter approach is generally not pursued in SMEs as development costs are deemed as too high. Thus, SMEs but even big companies like Goldman Sachs rely on solutions provided to them by developers and maybe tailored to their needs. The key-promises of HR Tech are that it empowers professionals by automating repetitive tasks, freeing time for strategic initiatives and innovation. By leveraging technology for recruitment and harnessing data-driven analytics, organizations enhance talent acquisition processes and make informed workforce decisions. This transformation not only boosts operational efficiency but also strengthens organizational agility, ensuring adaptability in an ever-evolving digital landscape (O'Connor 2020).
