“The use of data-driven AI models in recruitment processes raises a host of thorny ethical issues, which demand forethought and diligent assessment on the part of both system designers and procurers.”

 By Dr David Leslie, director of ethics and responsible innovation research at The Alan Turing Institute


  ## Introduction
The advent of algorithmic hiring and the rise of HR tech platforms has completely changed traditional recruitment practices, promising efficiency, mitigating biases prevalent in hiring and streamline decision making protocols. However, as companies rely on automated systems for HR functions, concerns regarding biases inherent in autonomous systems have come to the forefront. Our research paper delves into the intricate landscape of exploring the biases within HR tech companies and their potential impact. First, we navigate through the general development trends in HR tech platforms, we examine the evolution of the tools being developed and adopted by organizations. Secondly, we analyze the market characteristics shaping the adoption and implementation of HR tech solutions, by scrutinizing market dynamics, we may discern how biases may be perpetuated or mitigated within different HR tech platforms. Furthermore, we delve into the origin of discrimination embedded within these platforms, as historical biases affect these autonomous systems, even though they were claimed to be neutral, exacerbating disparities in hiring. By exploring these central issues through our research, where we analyze Talenteria, a HR Tech Recruiting platform startup. Our research aimed to find out whether there are potential AI biases in their CV screening algorithms focusing on age, gender, ethnicity and origin. Finally, we are going to discuss our results and the limitations of our study accordingly.
 


  ## General Developments and Trends 
HR-tech platforms can assume a variety of functions, spanning from recruiting and onboarding to learning/skills management and termination processes (Exh. 1). Established HR Tech functions also include Payroll Management (Statista 2022) which is not examined in this paper as it is not prone to bias. Organizations have the option to procure these diverse functionalities from one or multiple developers or to develop them entirely in-house. However, the latter approach is generally not pursued in SMEs as development costs are deemed as too high. Thus, SMEs but even big companies like Goldman Sachs rely on solutions provided to them by developers and maybe tailored to their needs. The key-promises of HR Tech are that it empowers professionals by automating repetitive tasks, freeing time for strategic initiatives and innovation. By leveraging technology for recruitment and harnessing data-driven analytics, organizations enhance talent acquisition processes and make informed workforce decisions. This transformation not only boosts operational efficiency but also strengthens organizational agility, ensuring adaptability in an ever-evolving digital landscape (O'Connor 2020).

<b>Exhibit 1: _HR Tech Capacities_</b>

 
## Market Characteristics 
Looking at the characteristics of the overall market, the HR sector is experiencing significant growth, both in terms of personnel utilization and revenues. This trend is primarily driven by the increasing focus of many companies on their labor force, particularly in light of the skills shortage. Furthermore, the scope of HR responsibilities has expanded significantly to include tasks such as employee training, performance monitoring and rewarding, and assisting employees in adapting to policy changes (Statista 2022). In the United States, which represents the largest market for HR and HR Tech, approximately 700,000 individuals were employed in the HR sector as of 2019 (Statista 2022). Despite the sector's contraction during the COVID-19 pandemic (approximately -15% in 2020), the projected growth until 2025 stands at around 18% (Statista 2022). Particularly noteworthy is the resilience of HR-tech companies offering a broad spectrum of services, which swiftly rebounded from the pandemic-induced downturn and are growing disproportionately compared to traditional HR firms (Statista 2022). The overall HR tech market is estimated at 62.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2022 and forecast to increase to 91.8 billion U.S. dollars by 2026 with a CAGR of 10.1 percent (Statista 2022). The market is dominated by incumbents (both specialized and unspecialized established HR Tech companies, which hold a market share of 91.9% in 2022 and are expected to retain a significant share (89.8%) in 2026. Many incumbents are connected to larger firms. For example, the online recruiting platform LinkedIn is owned by Microsoft and enjoys both the financial and institutional support of one of the original tech giants. Yet, the growth of startups is estimated with a CARG of 13.8% until 2026 outperforming incumbents (9.7%) significantly. This growth prospect for startups is driven by innovative firms particularly in Recruiting Software that offer a wider range of HR functions as incumbents are largely focused on personnel M&P and connectivity services (Statista 2022). However, the recruiting segment, exhibiting a significant market share of startups (25% in 2022), was impacted by geopolitical tensions and the associated macroeconomic effects including a tightening of the labor market. This impacts European HR Tech firms stronger than their US competitors (Statista 2022).
In conclusion, an examination of prevailing market trends reveals that the forefront of innovation and research and development (R&D) efforts predominantly resides within the domain of recruiting and talent management, a sector notably influenced by the initiatives of startups and smaller enterprises. Conversely, incumbents in the industry traditionally prioritize activities related to payroll management, which, prima facie, exhibit a lesser susceptibility to algorithmic discrimination. Consequently, given the focus of our project on investigating biases within automated decision-making systems (ADMS), the relevance of incumbent players in payroll management is deemed limited. Accordingly, our attention is directed towards HR Tech Startups like Talenteria, a startup specializing in recruiting HR technology, comprising fewer than 50 employees. Obviously, focussing on one firm poses challenges to the generalizability of our findings, however still might provide a first glimpse in both the quality and proneness to algorithmic biases of the services offered. It is imperative to recognize, however, that a comprehensive evaluation of biases within HR technology is currently impractical, primarily due to the nascent and dynamic nature of the market, largely characterized by the proliferation of young startups and a lack of consolidation.

  ## Literature Review 
_Introduction to Discrimination and Digital Ethics_
With the development of autonomous decision making systems, and its integration into our daily lives– particularly within the realm of human resource technology and global hiring practices, their impact grows ever more pronounced.  However, with the integration of these systems in society, arises the pressing questions regarding automotive systems, behavioral attributes and other ethical dilemmas. The autonomous systems trained by the HR tech ecosystem are anything but neutral, instead run the risk of perpetuating prejudices, stereotypes (Cave & Dihal, 2020; Drage & Mackereth, 2022). The consequence being the marginalization of communities. An expanding corpus of literature highlights the risks and challenges involved in the development of algorithms used for hiring with the apparent intention of mitigating biases. However, with the adoption of such technologies engenders significant repercussions in terms of inclusivity and intersectionality during the hiring process (Lee, 2018; Raghavan et al., 2020; Sánchez-Monedero et al., 2020; Benjamin, 2019). The increasing dependence on algorithms stems from their capacity to facilitate decision making, a pivotal factor driving their widespread adoption (Lee, 2018). Which raises the question regarding the reliability of these systems, and adopting a moral perspective focusing ethical considerations, inclusivity and equity. Given the importance of AI-driven HRM and its impact on society and the economy, there have been several projects on the nexus of ethics and HR Tech examined below. However, notably absent is a quantitative assessment of this issue.

## Origins of Discrimination
An increasing stream within literature endeavors to uncover the origins of algorithm biases in automated HR processes. While specific studies on this aspect of HR are scarce, we can draw insights from broader trends that explain algorithm biases. In a review of this topic, the GreenLining Institute (2021) identifies five main reasons that elucidate the occurrence of these algorithm biases and can be applied to HR processes. Firstly, data biases pose a significant challenge in HR algorithms as the algorithms learn from previous hiring data, which may inherently be discriminatory. If the previous hiring decisions exhibited a bias towards male candidates, the algorithm trained on such data might favor male candidates, perpetuating gender bias in the hiring process. Algorithm Design Choices also attenuate biases when designing algorithms for HR applications. The developer’s decision when defining selection criteria or predicting job performance can introduce biases. Subjective judgements in algorithm design may favor certain demographic characteristics over others, leading to discriminatory outcomes. Implicit biases among developers further compound the issue of algorithmic biases. 
Furthermore implicit biases among developers may compound the issue of algorithmic bias in HR processes. These unconscious biases can inadvertently affect decision making during algorithm design and development, contributing to discrimination during candidate selection. Feedback loops in HR algorithms also contribute to the reinforcement of biases over time. If an algorithm consistently recommends candidates from certain demographic groups for certain job roles, it may continue to perpetuate stereotypes, leading to underrepresentation of certain groups in the workforce. Finally the lack of regulation and oversight in the development and deployment of HR algorithms contribute to this problem. In the absence of proper guidelines and monitoring, developers may not prioritize fairness and equity in algorithmic decision making procedures related to hiring, promotion or performance evaluation. This dearth of oversight can continue the biases in HR practices, hindering diversity and inclusivity in the workforce.
